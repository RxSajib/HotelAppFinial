    <string name="welcometext">
        An Emirate on the rise, Ras AI Khaimah offers a luxurious yet reasonably priced gateway
for both leisure and business travelers. It is located in the Northern Emirates, just 45
minutes away from Dubai International Airport. Mangrove Hotel is ideally just five
minutes away from the heart of the city overlooking the impeccable mangrove islands
and lagoons, the Arabian Gulf and the majestic Al Hajar Mountains. Mangroves and
salt flats form a large part of the coastal and inland landscape. The mangroves, which
are home to a variety of wildlife, including flamingos, extend right into the Centre of Ras
Al Khaimah bringing a rich sense of nature into the city.
Visitors can explore the mangroves by taking kayak excursions and literally lose
themselves in the natural beauty.
